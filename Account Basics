## Account Basics

1. Create an IAM user for your personal use.
2. Set up MFA for your root user, turn off all root user API keys.
3. Set up Billing Alerts for anything over a few dollars.
4. Configure the AWS CLI for your user using API credentials.

**Checkpoint**: You can use the AWS CLI to interrogate information about your AWS account.


The overview of IAM is here: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home.

It gives you an overvew of some security settings that you should change. FIrst thing I did was walk through those:

1. Activate MFA on root account. I set mine with with Google Authenticator. 
2. Create a new user. I created mine with programmatic and AWS Mangement Console access.
      I didn't assign any permissions yet. I need to lookg through all the roles and assign the correct ones. I don't want to just give myself admin access, since that defeats the purpose of this section.
      On the IAM dashboard, under users, under this username, I uploaded my public SSH key. I figure I'll need this eventually.   
3. I added a group call myfrist group and added my account to it. I'll then add policies to this group instead of directly to my account.
      **edit** I ended up adding the following policies: AmazonEC2FullAccess
4. I updated the password requirements for IAM users. 

That wrapped up the Security Status area on the IAM dashboard. 


## Billing Alerts
Under Billing ->  preferences on the left menu, I enabled Billing Alerts.
The actual alarm is configured under CloudWatch, I configured an alert to email me if my account goes over $5 in a 6 hour period.
